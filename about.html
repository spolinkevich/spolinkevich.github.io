       <h3>We protect animals and the places they call home.</h3>

            Our vision is a world where animals are respected and protected. 
            We rescue individual animals, safeguard populations, preserve habitat, and advocate for a better future.
            Founded in 2000, we have provided almost 30 years of global leadership, innovation and hands-on 
            assistance to animals and communities in need. Our holistic conservation approach includes reducing 
            the demand and exploitation of wildlife at the source; working together with communities and enforcers 
            to shut down poaching networks; pioneering first-ever successes in the rescue, rehabilitation and 
            release of orphan animals back into the wild; activating where  needed most in the wake of global disasters; 
            and advocating through expert research and solutions to the greatest threats to our planetâ€™s populations and habitats.
